        <h2 class="two">Idecided to create this website because i've seen multiple videos and also heard that african americans don't get enough health care as other races because of the color of their skin.And this website will be a great access for black people to know this because the fact that most people don't know this is crazy.</h2>

                <p> <ul><li>The term "health disparities" is often defined as "a difference in which disadvantaged social groups such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women and other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more</li><li>
Compared with whites, members of racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to receive preventive health services and often receive lower-quality care. They also have worse health outcomes for certain conditions.</li><li>
For example, low-income people report worse health status than higher income individuals,7 and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals experience certain health challenges at increased rates.
